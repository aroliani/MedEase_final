## 🚀 What Is MedEase?

MedEase is a class project we made for our Wireless Mobile Programming course — basically a health app that *tries* to do a lot of cool things like booking lab tests, reading articles, and even buzzing your phone when you wave your hand.

It’s not perfect (some bugs here and there 👀), but it was fun to build and explore Android Studio as a team.

## ✨ Why We Built MedEase

We've been inspired by how juggling meds in daily life can be… messy. So we wanted a small app that's **useful, clean, and painless** — because managing health shouldn’t be another hassle.
